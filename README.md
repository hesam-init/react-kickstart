# React Kickstart 🚀

> A sleek and modern Vite + React + TypeScript starter template to kickstart your next project.

## 📚 Description

React Kickstart is a meticulously crafted starter template that provides a solid foundation for building high-performance React applications with TypeScript. It combines the lightning-fast build times of Vite with the robustness of React and the type safety of TypeScript, creating a delightful and productive development experience.

This template comes pre-configured with a suite of essential tools and libraries, including:

- **Code Styling and Linting**: Biome JS, an all-in-one tool for code formatting, linting, and enforcing best practices.
- **CSS Styling:** Support for CSS modules, Sass, and Tailwind CSS out of the box.
- **Routing:** Tanstack Router for efficient client-side routing.
- **Performance Optimization:** SWC for ultra-fast development builds and optimized production bundles.

With React Kickstart, you can hit the ground running and focus on building your features and components, without the hassle of setting up a complex development environment.
